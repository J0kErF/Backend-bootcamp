# CLI Game of Life
This is a command-line interface (CLI) for Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automata simulation where the fate of each cell depends on the state of its neighbors.

## Features:

- Simulate the Game of Life on an 8x8 grid.
- Allow user input to populate the board with live cells.
- Specify the number of simulation rounds.
- Display the grid after each round.

## Getting Started:

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
2. Clone or download the project repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the game using: `python main.py`

## Gameplay:

- The program will prompt you to enter the coordinates of live cells (e.g., "1,2" for row 1, column 2).
- Enter "done" when finished placing live cells. (the code accepts any value that not in coordinates format)
- Specify the number of simulation rounds you want to run.
- The program will display the grid after each round.
